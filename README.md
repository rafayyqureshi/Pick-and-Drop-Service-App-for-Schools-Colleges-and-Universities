Android Application

Abstract/Introduction
In today's world, the pick and drop of students at schools, colleges, and universities has become a challenging issue. Rush hours, especially during school off-timings, and traffic jams during school timings often lead to students arriving late at school and home. Individual student transportation using motorcycles, cars, and jeeps exacerbates problems such as traffic congestion, high fuel costs, and maintenance expenses. Furthermore, the economic crisis we face involves importing fuel and paying in foreign currency, which adds to the economic burden.

To address these challenges, the introduction of private transport services or school-owned pick and drop services for educational institutions can help save fuel and alleviate traffic congestion. The number of buses or private vehicles required for a school can range from 10 to 15, divided into 5 to 8 buses and 5 to 7 vans or rickshaws, which can be challenging for schools to manage independently. To make this solution feasible, a third-party service can assist schools, colleges, or universities in managing pick and drop services on an area-wise basis at an affordable monthly cost. To implement this, the services of transport companies or private van or rickshaw owners will be enlisted. To facilitate this solution, the development of an Android app is essential, with the following functionalities:

Functional Requirements:
Provide an interface for transport companies to register with the application.
Provide an interface for private van or rickshaw owners to register with the application.
Offer basic route information from schools, colleges, or universities to the main road on which registered buses, vans, or rickshaws operate.
Allow the registration of schools, colleges, or universities for which pick and drop services will be provided.
Record and manage the number of buses or private vans/rickshaws assigned to each school, college, or university.
Provide an interface for registering students under their respective school, college, or university for pick and drop services.
Automatically define routes and allocate buses, vans, or rickshaws if available for the specified student address.
Calculate pick and drop charges based on the distance from the school to the destination, managed via the app, and calculate these charges on a monthly basis.
Enable schools, colleges, or universities to collect pick and drop charges on a monthly basis and facilitate the submission of these charges to the transportation company through the app's interface.
Include an interface for daily attendance records for each ride.
Manage payment records for each transport company or individual through the app.
